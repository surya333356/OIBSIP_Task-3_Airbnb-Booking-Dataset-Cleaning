# OIBSIP_Task-3_Airbnb-Booking-Dataset-Cleaning

# Project Summary -

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values.
